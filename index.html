<p>October 2013 I came down with a touch of lymphoma and spent fourteen months married to a chemo pump. Cancer patients have a generous amount of time to spend studying and reading, and I remain an <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/10454947-chris-vogt?shelf=read" title="Chris Vogt on Goodreads">assiduous reader</a> to this day. I also <a href="https://youtu.be/B6z4WvaFP1U?list=PLNpEtdDfoma2QoX2Oxn8tvybYoiQI_yz_" title="Chris Vogt playing piano on YouTube">play tunes on the piano</a>.</p>

<p>I have been in full remission since January. ðŸ’ª A few months before that I returned to school full time for discipline, structure, and networking, and in 2016 will likely transfer somewhere to study engineering, computer science, or philosophy.</p>
