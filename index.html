<p>In the real world I inhabit Phoenix, Arizona, USA. Between five and ten weekday evenings I can typically be spotted near N33° 29.0744′, W112° 5.3194′.</p>

<p>The end of 2013 I came down with a touch of lymphoma and spent fourteen months married to a chemo pump. Cancer patients have a generous amount of time to spend reading and learning, and I remain an <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10454947-chris-vogt" title="Chris Vogt on Goodreads">assiduous reader</a> to this day. I also frequently <a href="https://youtu.be/B6z4WvaFP1U?list=PLNpEtdDfoma2QoX2Oxn8tvybYoiQI_yz_" title="Chris Vogt playing piano on YouTube">play tunes on the piano</a>.</p>

<p>Fall 2014 I returned to school full time for discipline, structure, and networking, and in 2016 will likely transfer somewhere to study engineering or philosophy. I have been in full remission since January and now sport hair and a handsome beard.</p>

<p>Prior the disruption, my professional endeavors have been in eDiscovery, EdTech, and Health Care as a web developer and engineer. I am a strong proponent of the Open Web Platform and actively contribute to and maintain projects written in JavaScript, PHP, and Python <em>int. al.</em></p>

<p>For now, I remain poised to rise to the occasion.</p>
