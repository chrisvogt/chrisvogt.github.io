<p>In the real world I inhabit Phoenix, Arizona, USA. Between five and ten weekday evenings I can typically be spotted near N33° 29.0744′, W112° 5.3194′.</p>
<p>When I’m not there you can find me online, often lurking in an IRC channel, reading or writing technical documentation, and constantly contributing to projects on GitHub. If all else fails, look for me at the dog park reading an analog book near a golden and a catahoula.</p>
<p>This site does not exist to sell you things. I use tools to build tools that solve challanges which pique my curiosity, and by releasing my projects open source I invite and encourage others to scrutinize, make suggestions to, and improve upon the codebase.</p>
<p>Should you find an invalid statement on my site or in my code consider taking the time to refute it and set me straight. Let’s work together to keep the World Wild Web clean and free of noise.</p>
