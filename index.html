Between five and ten weekday evenings I can typically be spotted near N33° 29.0744′, W112° 5.3194′.</p>
<p>When I’m not there you can find me online, often lurking in an IRC channel, reading or writing documentation, forking projects and pushing commits to Github <a href="https://github.com/chrisvogt"><i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>, or digging through the depths of information scattered throughout the Web. If all else fails, look for me at the dog park reading an analog book near a golden and a catahoula.</p>
<p>This site does not exist for me to market myself, my services, or my products. It is here to record my thoughts, projects, and ideas while also functioning as a reference to my content input and output. I will attempt to sell you nothing and you won’t find me throwing around my résumé <a href="http://resume.chrisvogt.me"><i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a> like a two-bit business card. (Catch what I did there?)</p>
<p>Should you find an invalid or outdated statement on my site, consider taking the time to refute it and set me straight. Let’s work together to keep the internet free of garbage and noise.</p>
