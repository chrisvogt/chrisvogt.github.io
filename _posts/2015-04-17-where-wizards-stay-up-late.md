<em>Where Wizards Stay Up Late</em> is a best-selling history of the Internet documented by former New York Times journalist Katie Hafner and her late husband Matthew Lyon, former UC Berkeley assistant and vice chancellor of public affairs.

If you are like me, our crossover into the online world happened in the mid-1990s as the World Wide Web gained prevalence in mainstream culture. While I was very young at the time, I can pull up memories from a time before social networking apps, mobile phones, and a plethora of process that are now automated and machine-based. However, for members of many younger generations the Internet, and the technology that has grown from it, has drastically shaped the world and society they are coming of age into. This is the detailed saga of how it all began.

A few notable figures followed in the book are:

<strong>J.C.R Licklider</strong> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._C._R._Licklider" title="J.C.R. Licklider on Wikipedia"><i class="pw-icon-link-ext"></i></a> has been referred to as "the Johnny Appleseed of computing" for contributing research, theories, and funding to computing and networking as an engineering grad student and later as head of the Information Processing Techniques Office (IPTO) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Processing_Techniques_Office" title="IPTO on Wikipedia"><i class="pw-icon-link-ext"></i></a> at DARPA. Licklider's academic studies were in psychoacoustics, psychology, physics, and mathematics.

<img src="http://www.ibiblio.org/pioneers/images/pics/Baran.jpg" width="208" height="251" alt="Paul Baran" class="img img-thumbnail pull-left" />

<strong>Paul Baran</strong> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Baran" title="Paul Baran on Wikipedia"><i class="pw-icon-link-ext"></i></a>, who arrived at a concept for packet switched networked computing [l] coincidentally around the same time as an engineer in the UK (Davies). Baran's academic studies had been in electrical engineering, and developed primitive theories on distributed communications while at the Research ANd Development (RAND) corporation <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAND_Corporation" title="The RAND Corporation on Wikipedia"><i class="pw-icon-link-ext"></i></a> in the early 1960s.

<strong>Donald Davies</strong> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Davies" title="Donald Davies on Wikipedia"><i class="pw-icon-link-ext"></i></a> received his undergraduate in physics in the early 1940s and a graduate degree in mathematics a few years later, after which he went on to work at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Physical_Laboratory_%28United_Kingdom%29" title="NPL on Wikipedia"><i class="pw-icon-link-ext"></i></a> where Alan Turing was bringing his theories on computing machines to life. In response to a visit to MIT in the 1960s, Davies contributed to work on packet-switching communications networks designed to help distribute loads on time-sharing computer systems of the time.

<strong>Dick Bolt</strong> and <strong>Leo Beranek</strong>, who worked together to perform analysis on the JFK assassination and Nixon White House tapes. Together, with <strong>Robert Numan</strong>, they formed the small, acoustical consulting firm Bolt, Baranek, and Numan (BBN) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBN_Technologies" title="BBN Technologies on Wikipedia"><i class="pw-icon-link-ext"></i></a>, later contracted by DARPA to build the ARPANET and other early Internet networks.

<strong>Vint Cerf</strong> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vint_Cerf" title="Vint Cerf on Wikipedia"><i class="pw-icon-link-ext"></i></a>, considered one of "the fathers of the Internet" for his technology research funding while a manager at DARPA in its early days. Together with Bob Khan, he went on to co-found the non-profit Internet Society (iSoc) <a href="http://www.internetsociety.org" title="internetsociety.org"><i class="pw-icon-link-ext"></i></a> to provide leadership in Internet-related standards, leadership, and education.

<strong>Bob Khan</strong> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Kahn" title="Bob Khan on Wikipedia"><i class="pw-icon-link-ext"></i></a>, an assistant professor at MIT and AT&T employee who went on to work for BBN and helped develop the Interface Message Processor (IMP) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_Message_Processor" title="Interface Message Processor on Wikipedia"><i class="pw-icon-link-ext"></i></a> responsible for managing the ARPANET's network communications traffic. The concepts behind the IMPs later became what we today know as routers, and together with Vint Cerf he helped develop the Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol, or TCP/IP.

Together, the individuals, theories, and stories outlined in <em>Where Wizards Stay Up Late</em> set the precedence for what we today refer to as the Internet, a distributed network of computing systems linked together through a packet switching network.
