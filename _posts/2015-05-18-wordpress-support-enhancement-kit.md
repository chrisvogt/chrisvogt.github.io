<img src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/chrisvogt/wordpress-support-enhancement-kit/master/screenshot.gif" width="400" alt="Wordpress.org Support Extension Kit" class="img pull-right" /> I have released a Chrome extension on the Chrome Web Store called the Wordpress.org Support Forum Extension Kit.

While replying to questions on the Wordpress.org support forum I have grown bored with the current state of the forum UI. This Chrome extension allows me to override the styles, scripts, and hack the Wordpress.org support forum into something I find pleasing.
