This week I took Polymer out for a test drive and refactored Joel Sutherland's awesome GitHub jQuery Repo Widget <a href="http://www.newmediacampaigns.com/blog/a-beautiful-jquery-github-widget" title="GitHub jQuery Repo Widget"><i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a> into a custom Polymer element.

Polymer is a pioneering library built on top of Web Components <a href="http://webcomponents.org" title="Discuss and evolve Web Components best-practices"><i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>, a set of standards currently being produced by Google's Web Platform team to provide custom and interoperable components for the web. Neither Polymer nor Web Components are frameworks - they are built to work <em>with</em> everything else so that when you build something awesome anyone, anywhere can use it.

Head on over to polymer-project.org <a href="https://www.polymer-project.org" title="Polymer web library"><i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a> to learn more about Polymer.
